Kinematics
==========

This is a library of component models, tests and examples that
demonstrate some interesting ways to model transmission components in
Modelica by describing the component and/or subsystem's functional
behavior through kinematic constraints.

The code from the library is used in a series of posts on the [Xogeny
blog](http://blog.xogeny.com).

In this package, you will find an `Examples` package for models that
demonstrate the function of the models.  You will also find a `Tests`
package.  The `Tests` package is for testing and the models contained
in that package require the
[`XogenyTest`](https://github.com/xogeny/XogenyTest) package in order
compile.
