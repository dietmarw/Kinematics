Kinematics
==========

This is a library of component models, tests and examples that demonstrate some interesting ways
to model transmission components in Modelica by describing the component and/or subsystem's functional
behavior through kinematic constraints.

The code from the library is used in a series of posts on the [Xogeny blog](http://blog.xogeny.com).
